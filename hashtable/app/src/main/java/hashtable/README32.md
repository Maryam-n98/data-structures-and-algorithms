# Hashmap Tree Intersection

# Challenge Summary
write a method that take two binary tree and return array of node 

## Whiteboard Process
![hashmap](https://github.com/Maryam-n98/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/hashtable/app/src/main/java/hashtable/img/code32.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
write a traverse method 
it will be traverses the second tree then take the value of node as a key in the hashmap
then we have compare method to loop the first tree and compare if the node value include in the hashmap
if its contian it will push the value to the array
