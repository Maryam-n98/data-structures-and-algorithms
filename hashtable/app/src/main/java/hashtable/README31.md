## Approach & Efficiency
FIRST CREATED HASH MAP AND THEN CREATED A FOR LOOP AND SPILTEACH WORD AFTER THAT HAVE IF STATMENT THAT IF THE WORD CONTAIN , AND REMOVE IT AND WILL WALK THROUGH EACH STRING AND GIVE IT A KEY FOR EACH ONE AND IF THERE SIMILER WORD MAKE THE VALUE PLUS ONE BUT IF IT FINISH AND WE HAVNT SIMILER RETURN A STRING "no reapeated word"
