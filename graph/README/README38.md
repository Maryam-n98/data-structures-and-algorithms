# Graph Depth First

# Challenge Summary
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O: O(n)
## Solution
First I Create a method that takes string then declare set list and stack after that create while loop to walkthrogh the stack
then create if statement to check if the string value is exist in the set or not to add value to set
Finally create for loop to add all neighbors of vertex
