# Singly Linked List
A linked list is a way to store a collection of elements. Like an array, these can be characters or integers. Each element in a linked list is stored in the form of a node.

## Challenge
In this Challenge, We had Node and LinkedList that applied some methods to display the values of our Nodes inside the LinkedList according to their addresses by inserting a new one instead of the first node that took the head place and tests some values if there are inside our nodes or not by the boolean method that gives us true or false.
finally, the results should be string.

## Approach & Efficiency
-   Verify Big O(1) of written code.
-    Verify code matches algorithm.
-    Explain testing according to inputs and outputs.

## API
insert()
to add a new Node to LinkedList 
show()
to display our Nodes by considering every address != null 
search()
to test our Nodes' values if they are found so the test gives us true or reverse via.
toString()
to get String result.
